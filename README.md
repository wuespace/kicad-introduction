# KiCad Introduction

This project hosts the source files for a lecture about the ECAD tool
[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

## Presentation Folder

The presentation is done with LaTex beamer. The style file is custom tailored to the WÃ¼Space CI
guidelines (roboto and comfortaa font, correct accent purple) and can be swapped out if holding the lecture in a
different context.

## Tasks Folder

This folder is for KiCAD project files that correspond to the lecture. Currently there's only the
project `baby-steps` but more can be added for further advanced lectures.
